Diana moved to Italy in her teens and later settled in the UK. Aside from the programming languages she has recently learned from [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/), she is also fluent in 4 spoken and written languages.

Previously she has held a variety of jobs, most recently as a digital producer for a large events company, learning new technologies and mentoring colleages to gain their own expertise in them. In this role, Diana worked with designers and programmers who inspired her interest in web development.

She undertook the [Coding Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) to realise her ambition to work in software development and is enhancing and developing her computer science, coding skills and technical competencies.

Formerly an adult skills teacher and permaculture designer, Zan is also the National Chair of the Northern Independence Party.

Her interest in permaculture systems aligns well with good practice and effective design in software development, and this largely influenced her decision to become a developer.

As well as politics, permaculture, education and the environment, Zan is passionate about music and plays the trumpet, piano, steel drums, and the ukulele. She loves the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPGs, and one day, it is said, the Elder Scrolls series of games will need to be prised from her cold, dead hands.
