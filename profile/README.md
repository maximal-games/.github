Di moved to Italy in her teens and later settled in the UK. Aside from the programming languages she has recently learned from [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/), she is also fluent in 4 spoken and written languages.

Previously she has held a variety of jobs, most recently as a digital producer for a large events company, learning new technologies and mentoring colleages to gain their own expertise in them. In this role, Di worked with designers and programmers who inspired her interest in web development.

She undertook the [Coding Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) to realise her ambition to work in software development and is enhancing and developing her computer science, coding skills and technical competencies.

Tomasz loves to travel, and his professional work has almost always been related to it. After years of navigating ships, buses and taxis, he decided to take a course in the programming world.

He has always enjoyed working at the computer; not only playing games, but also learning all sorts of software, so why not try a real job in the industry?

As he was learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript on his own, and then more advanced topics with Northcoders, he got to like it and is now looking for a technical role where he can put these skills to use.

After working in retail and distribution sector, Yuri has decided this is not his cup of tea! This motivated him to start his path as a self taught programmer, learning python and web development in his spare time.

This year he joined the Northcoders Bootcamp and completely enjoyed getting stuck in with JavaScript which allowed him to combine his interest in technology with his passion to solve logic problems.

He loves sport, reading and finances and is excited to start a career as a full stack software developer.

Formerly an adult skills teacher and permaculture designer, Zan is also the National Chair of the Northern Independence Party.

Her interest in permaculture systems aligns well with good practice and effective design in software development, and this largely influenced her decision to become a developer.

As well as politics, permaculture, education and the environment, Zan is passionate about music and plays the trumpet, piano, steel drums, and the ukulele. She loves the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPGs, and one day, it is said, the Elder Scrolls series of games will need to be prised from her cold, dead hands.
